    <h1 id="about">ABOUT</h1>
    <p class="text--pop">Hey everyone! My name is Anthony Curtis and I am a JavaScript Developer interested in design.</p>
    <br>

    <p>I almost pursued a PhD in order to become a Physical Therapist. <strong>I’m glad I didn’t</strong>.</p>
    <br>

    <p><strong>I fell in love</strong> with the world of <strong>technology</strong> and <strong>good design</strong> – not to mention how much it simplifies life – with the advent of smart products and services offered by companies like:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Google – The world’s most popular search engine that grants everyone <strong>access to the world’s knowledge</strong>.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Apple – A premium company that <strong>revolutionized the smartphone and wafer-thin laptop industries</strong> with its top-notch computers and smartphones (Seriously, the iPhone X is “top-notch”).</p>
      </li>
      
      <li>
        <p>Tesla – <strong>Electrifying the automotive industry</strong> with its beautiful, autonomous, space-ship like vehicles that outperform super cars – <span class="text--pop">even if it’s a sedan</span>.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <br> 
    <p>Having the <strong>freedom to enter</strong> into <strong>any domain</strong> of technology <strong>anywhere in the world</strong> – given a year or so of practice – and to be paid generously to <strong>do what you love</strong>:  </p>

    <p class="text--pop">Building things to make people’s lives simpler, safer, and that much more enjoyable to live. </p>

    <p><strong>Who would want to pass that up?</strong></p>
    
    <p>It is with this mindset that I hold myself accountable throughout the areas of my life. </p>

    <p>*Will fill out!*</p>

    <h3>RoboFriends</h3>
    <p>A sample React app featuring Tachyons CSS, jsonplaceholder, and robohash api.
 
      I built it to better understand React’s one-way data flow structure as well as its component-based attitude. 
      
      I came away from this project feeling like React enforces clean, quality coding habits.</p>

    <h3>Code Dangerously</h3>
    <p>The first large project I built while learning to code! 

      A responsive sample website built with HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. It is DRY and modular in nature due to the static-site builder, Jekyll. </p>
